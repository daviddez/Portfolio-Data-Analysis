# Portfolio-Data-Analysis
Using python and jupyter notebooks analyze and prepare data.

## Description
These files contain personal projects that I have completed through institutional training or personal projects of interest.  They have all broadened my understanding of programming and data science and I have posted them here to share and motivate/inspire others to pursue the same endeavors. 

## Projects:
### Text Analysis - 12 Princesses .ipynb
  This workbook will uses the Natural Language Toolkit Library (nltk) to look at the contents of 12dancingprincesses.txt file (located in /datasets). I will clean the text by removing all punctuation and stopwords('english') before pulling the top ten words used in the file.
