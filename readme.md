# Portfolio-Data-Analysis
Using python and jupyter notebooks to analyze and prepare data.

## Description
These files contain personal projects that I have completed through institutional training or personal projects of interest.  They have all broadened my understanding of programming and data science and I have posted them here to share and motivate/inspire others to pursue the same endeavors. 

## Projects:
### Supervised - Naive Bayes - Gaussian and Bernoulli 
Model the data, Titanic dataset (located in /datasets). To use predictive analysis for both the Gaussian and Bernoulli Naive Bayes, seeing which will be more accurate at predicting the surival rate.
### Text Analysis - 12 Princesses
  This workbook will uses the Natural Language Toolkit Library (nltk) to look at the contents of 12dancingprincesses.txt file (located in /datasets). 
### Text Analysis - Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews
This workbook will use the Natural Language Toolkit Library (nltk) to analyze and process a pandas dataframe, using the Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews from kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews).
### Unsupervised - K-Means Clustering
Using the Kaggle dataset 'ccdata' from https://www.kaggle.com/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata, Use K-Means clustering to group and then predict a new value against the model.
