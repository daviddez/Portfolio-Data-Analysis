# Portfolio-Data-Analysis
Using python, jupyter notebooks, and data to analyze and prepare data before processing.

## Description
These files contain personal projects that I have completed through institutional training or personal projects of interest.  They have all broadened my understanding of programming and data science and I have posted them here to share and motivate/inspire others to pursue the same endeavors. 

## Projects:
### Text Analysis - 12 Princesses .ipynb
This workbook will use the Natural Language Toolkit Library (nltk) to look at the words and sentences in the 12dancingprincesses.txt file. I will clean the text by removing all punctuation and stopwords('english') before pulling the top ten used file.
